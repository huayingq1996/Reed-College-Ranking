# A True Lie about Reed College: U.S News Ranking
![](img/2019pcrPI_1.png)
The annual Best College Rankings published by U.S. News \& Worlds Report are held by many as the prominent college rankings to consult with. However, the weight-and-sum model used has long been criticized for not reflecting the true educational quality of institutions. A few institutions, such as Reed College in 1995, announced refusal to continue participating in the USNWR college rankings. Itâ€™s claimed that the ranks of the non-reporting institutions then penalized and deliberately under-ranked. This research used Principal Component Regression and Elastic Net Regularized Regression methods to build predictive models, aiming to reproduce the USNWR College Rankings published in 2009 and 2019 and assess if non-reporting schools are truly under-ranked. As a result, even thought no systematic under-rank of non-reporting institutions was found, Reed College was shown to be the only institution significantly under-ranked by USNWR both in 2009 and 2019.
